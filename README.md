About
UnlockTool bundles multiple modules into one utility. Each module targets a task:
- Unlock partitions and bootloader.
- Bypass Google FRP locks.
- Remove Apple ID activation lock in specific cases.
- Unlock screen locks (PIN, pattern, password).
- Handle device-specific flows for Samsung and other OEMs.
The tool uses standard ADB, fastboot, and vendor-specific protocols. Use the Releases page to download the asset and run the executable for your host OS.

Key features
- One download for multiple unlock tasks.
- ADB and fastboot automation.
- Samsung-mode handlers (Download/Odin mode).
- FRP bypass flows for modern Android builds.
- Apple ID support for activation unlock procedures where legal access exists.
- Screen unlock methods for encrypted and non-encrypted partitions.
- Small footprint binary with short startup time.
- Simple GUI and a robust CLI for automation.

Supported devices and partitions
- Android phones (all common vendors).
- Samsung Galaxy series (Odin/Download, ADB, AP, BL handling).
- iPhone models up to recent iOS releases for supported activation flows.
- Support for Android partitions: boot, recovery, system, vendor, userdata.
- Support for OEM partitions used in unlock and repair flows.

Install and quick start
1. Visit the Releases page and download the file for your OS:
   - Windows: .exe
   - macOS: .dmg or .pkg
   - Linux: tar.gz or AppImage
2. Execute the downloaded file. The Releases page hosts the assets that you must download and run.
3. Connect the target phone by USB.
4. Enable USB Debugging or enter the device into the required mode (Download, Fastboot, Recovery).
5. Run the tool and select the flow you need.

Note on the Releases link
- The Releases URL above contains a path. Download the file listed there and execute it on your host system to use the utility.

Step-by-step workflows

FRP bypass (Android)
- Connect phone to the host.
- Enable USB Debugging or boot to recovery/ADB mode.
- Start UnlockTool and select "FRP Bypass".
- The tool pushes a helper APK to device and launches a handshake.
- Follow on-screen prompts to complete the bypass.
- Reboot the device and confirm account removal.

Bootloader unlock (Android)
- Install device drivers if needed.
- Reboot phone to fastboot mode (`fastboot` for most Android).
- Use UnlockTool "Bootloader" module.
- The tool runs fastboot commands to unlock the bootloader. Example:
  - `fastboot oem unlock` or `fastboot flashing unlock`
- Confirm unlock on the device screen when prompted.
- Reboot and verify unlock state.

Samsung special modes
- For Samsung, enter Download/Odin mode: Power off, hold Volume Down + Bixby/Home + Power (varies).
- Connect via USB. Odin mode shows a yellow status.
- Use UnlockTool "Samsung" module for AP/BL flashing or binary actions.
- The tool automates safe flashing and partition repairs.

Apple ID / Activation lock (iPhone)
- Connect iPhone via USB to the host.
- Use the Activation module to detect device status and allowed flows.
- UnlockTool lists available actions depending on model and iOS build.
- Follow step prompts. The tool applies authorized flows where supported.
- Some models require additional files or proofs. Check the Releases page for model-specific assets.

Screen unlock (PIN, pattern, password)
- For many Android versions, the tool uses ADB to remove `gesture.key` or `password.key`.
- For encrypted userdata, use the dedicated module for pattern removal after temporary boot to patched recovery or shim.
- The tool supports Samsung fingerprint removal and re-pair flows when the hardware allows.
- After unlock, reboot the device and set a new screen lock.

CLI and GUI usage
- GUI mode opens a window and lists modules. Click a module, follow prompts.
- CLI mode is script friendly.
  - Example commands (showing style only; run the downloaded executable with flags):
    - `UnlockTool --list-devices`
    - `UnlockTool --frp-bypass --device 0123456`
    - `UnlockTool --bootloader-unlock --fastboot`
- Logs are stored in the local folder under `logs/`. Use logs to inspect failed flows.

Troubleshooting checklist
- Device not detected:
  - Install OEM drivers or ADB drivers.
  - Try a different USB cable or port.
  - Use a host USB port directly. Avoid USB hubs.
- Fastboot not found:
  - Ensure platform-tools are in PATH or use the bundled fastboot.
- Permission errors on Linux/macOS:
  - Make the binary executable: `chmod +x UnlockTool` and run with proper permissions.
  - On macOS allow the app in System Preferences if blocked.
- Module fails mid-flow:
  - Check logs in `logs/`.
  - Reboot device and host, reconnect, and retry.
- Samsung stuck in bootloop:
  - Try flash stock AP and BL with the Samsung module or official Odin.
- Apple ID flow not available:
  - The tool reports supported models and allowed actions. Some servers require legal proof or vendor support.

Safety and legal note
- Use the tool only on devices you own or manage.
- Respect local law and carrier policies.
- The tool reports RBI details and does not bypass remote locks that require carrier intervention.
